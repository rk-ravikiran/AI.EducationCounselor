### Financial Strategy

Given your budget category, we'll focus on maximizing financial aid. Singapore's universities offer various support schemes:

*   **Need-Based Bursaries:** Most institutions, including NUS, NTU, and SMU, offer robust bursary programs that can significantly offset tuition fees.
*   **Tuition Grant Scheme (TGS):** This is a government subsidy for Singaporean and Permanent Resident students, significantly reducing tuition costs for many undergraduate degrees.
*   **SkillsFuture:** While primarily for upskilling, certain SkillsFuture initiatives might offer course fee subsidies for specific relevant short courses or modules if you opt for a polytechnic diploma first.
*   **CPF Education Scheme:** If you are a Singaporean Permanent Resident, you can utilize your CPF Ordinary Account savings for tuition fees.

We will help you explore specific bursary applications once you decide on your preferred program. The "Need-Based Bursary" with an approximate amount of S$2,000 is a starting point, but actual amounts can vary significantly based on individual financial circumstances.

### Skill Development Plan

To further strengthen your profile, consider focusing on these areas:

*   **Python Programming for Data Analysis:** Essential for both AI and FinTech.
*   **Financial Modelling:** Crucial for finance roles.
*   **Machine Learning Fundamentals:** To deepen your AI knowledge.

We recommend utilizing **SkillsFuture** resources and online platforms like **Coursera** or **edX** for these skills. Look for introductory courses on Python (e.g., Python for Everybody) and Machine Learning. Dedicate time for this between now and your application period in **August-September 2025** for the **August 2026 intake**.
