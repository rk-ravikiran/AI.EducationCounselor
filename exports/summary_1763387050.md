### Financial Strategy

Given your budget category, it's crucial to explore financial aid. Singapore offers several avenues:

*   **MOE Tuition Grant:** This significantly subsidizes tuition fees for Singaporean students and eligible international students who commit to working in Singapore for a period after graduation.
*   **University-Specific Bursaries:** NUS, NTU, and SMU offer need-based bursaries. The "Need-Based Bursary" mentioned with an approximate amount of S$2,000 is a good starting point to investigate further.
*   **SkillsFuture:** While primarily for upskilling, some SkillsFuture initiatives might indirectly support your education journey or future career development.
*   **CPF Education Scheme:** If you have parents or guardians who are Singaporean CPF contributors, they can utilize their CPF savings for your education.

We recommend exploring these options thoroughly as they can drastically reduce the financial burden.

### Skill Development Plan

1.  **Advanced Programming Skills (Python):** Essential for both AI and FinTech. Focus on libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn for AI, and potentially those used in financial modeling.
2.  **Financial Modeling & Data Analysis Tools:** Familiarize yourself with Excel for financial modeling and explore BI tools like Tableau or Power BI.
3.  **Understanding of AI Concepts:** Gain a conceptual understanding of machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and their applications.

**Resources:** Utilize **SkillsFuture** for subsidised courses, and explore online platforms like Coursera, edX, or Udacity for specific technical skills. Aim to complete foundational courses before your application window opens.
